# hello-world
My first repository!

This site will be the depository for code that I write. I'll post things that I am working on and code from my papers, which will help people repeat my analyses. Unfortunately, I probably wont be able to commit model runs that I have completed - if you are interested in those then let's talk!

My website is https://seamanticscience.wordpress.com/
